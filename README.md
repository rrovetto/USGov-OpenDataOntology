# The U.S. Government Open Data Ontology

### Scope
The scope of the U.S. Government Open Data activities, specifically as described at [this official website](https://data.gov). The content of the [User Guide](https://data.gov/user-guide/) is relevant. The scope is subject to revision.

### Purpose
* To support the U.S. Government Open Data activities, by developing an ontology and determining if it can help with data access and management in those activities
* To explore the potential utility of ontology / semantic modeling / conceptual data modeling / AI knowledge representation / knowledge grahs (here collectively called 'knowledge modeling) for the SMD and the given scope.
* To innovate

### Status
- Draft. In-progress. 
- As a personal project, unfunded to date, formal support is needed to continue and sustain development

## Relevant works & Content
- "The OPEN Government Data Act makes Data.gov a requirement in statute, rather than a policy. It requires federal agencies to publish their information online as open data, using standardized, machine-readable data formats, with their metadata included in the Data.gov catalog. [...] Data.gov is working with an expanded group of federal agencies to include their datasets in Data.gov as they implement the law. [...] Data.gov is the federal government's open data site, and aims to make government more open and accountable." (source: https://data.gov/open-gov/ 24 May 2023)
- "Data.gov was built with open source software"
